## About Me

Hi, my name is **Irene Kibet**, I am a data enthusiast hailing from the vibrant landscapes of Kenya. My journey began in the realm of customer service, where for a decade, I dedicated myself to enhancing customer experiences and driving profitability for various organizations. This experience ignited in me a passion for data and its transformative potential.

Recognizing that data is the backbone of strategic decision-making in todayâ€™s business world, I decided to pivot my career towards data science. 
My goal? To harness the power of data to influence decisions and make a tangible impact on the organizations I collaborate with.

I am currently seeking new opportunities and I am open to relocating anywhere in the US. 

Let's set up a call to chat about how I can help your organization to thrive.
