Over the years, I have\n            helped organizations achieve profitability by improving\n            their customer experience. After spending close to 10 years\n            in the field of customer service, I felt the urge to\n            transition into a career that will put me at the forefront\n            of decision-making processes. I realized that data is the\n            driving force behind many business strategies today, and\n            being able to interpret and utilize this data could allow me\n            to make a more direct impact on the organizations I work\n            with. I am currently seeking new opportunities and am open\n            to relocating anywhere in the US.
