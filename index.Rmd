## About Me

Hi, my name is **Irene Kibet**, I am an aspiring data analyst from Kenya. Over the years, I have helped organizations achieve profitability by improving their customer experience. After spending close to 10 years in the field of customer service, I felt the urge to transition into a career that will put me at the forefront of decision-making processes. I realized that data is the driving force behind many business strategies today, and being able to interpret and utilize this data could allow me to make a more direct impact on the organizations I work with. 
I am currently seeking new opportunities and am open to relocating anywhere in the US. Let's set up a call to chat about how I can help your organization to thrive.
